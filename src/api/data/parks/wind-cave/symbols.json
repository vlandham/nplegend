  "Description": "Wind Cave is distinctive for its calcite fin formations called boxwork and needle-like growths called frostwork. Additionally, it is the world's densest and most complex cave system. Above ground is a mixed-grass prairie with animals such as bison, black-footed ferrets, and prairie dogs.[62] and ponderosa pine forests home to cougars and elk. It is culturally significant to the Lakota people as the site in which their emergence story takes place."
