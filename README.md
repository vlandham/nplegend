# MLab Visualizations

This project contains the web client for Measurement Lab visualizations.


## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Using webpack-dashboard

If you prefer to have webpack rendered in a dashboard, use two separate terminal windows.
In one, run webpack with:

```bash
npm run webpack-dashboard
```

And in the other, run the web server with:

```bash
npm run start-dev
```

Note that the dashboard adds roughly 500ms to the webpack rebuild time.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Production Server

```bash
npm run start
```
